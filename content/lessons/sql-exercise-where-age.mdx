## Exercise: Find Students by Age

Write a query to find all students who are 12 years old.

## Task

Select all students where age equals 12.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE age = 12;
```

## Expected Output

| id | name | age | course | marks | grade |
|----|------|-----|--------|-------|-------|
| 2 | Bob | 12 | JavaScript | 78 | B |
| 5 | Eve | 12 | Python | 88 | A |

## Numeric Comparisons

When filtering by numbers:

```sql
-- No quotes needed for numbers
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age = 12;

-- This also works but is redundant
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age = '12';
```

## Multiple Age Queries

```sql
-- Students who are 14
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age = 14;

-- Students who are 15
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age = 15;

-- Students with marks of 85
SELECT * FROM students WHERE marks = 85;
```

## Key Differences

| Type | Example | Quotes |
|------|---------|--------|
| String | `'Python'` | Required |
| Number | `12` | Not required |
| Date | `'2024-01-01'` | Required |

## Next Steps

We'll learn to filter with inequalities: less than, greater than, and more!
