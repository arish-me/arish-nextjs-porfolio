## What is Branching?

Branching is one of Git's most powerful features. A branch allows you to diverge from the main line of development and work independently without affecting other branches.

## Why Use Branches?

### 1. Parallel Development

Work on multiple features simultaneously:

```
main ────●────●────●────●────●
              │
feature-a     └──●──●──●
              │
feature-b     └──●──●
```

### 2. Isolated Changes

Keep experimental work separate from stable code:

```bash
# Create a branch for experiments
git checkout -b experiment

# Try risky changes safely
# If it works: merge
# If it fails: delete the branch
```

### 3. Team Collaboration

Each team member works on their own branch:

```
main ────●────●────●────●
              │
alice-feature └──●──●──●
              │
bob-bugfix    └──●──●
```

## How Branches Work

### The Pointer Concept

A branch is simply a pointer to a commit:

```
          HEAD
            ↓
main ──●──●──●
              ↑
          branch pointer
```

Creating a branch just creates a new pointer:

```
main ──●──●──●
              ↑
        feature (new branch)
```

### HEAD Pointer

`HEAD` points to your current branch:

```bash
# Check where HEAD points
cat .git/HEAD
# ref: refs/heads/main
```

## Branch Naming Conventions

### Common Patterns

```bash
# Feature branches
feature/user-authentication
feature/shopping-cart
feature/payment-integration

# Bug fix branches
bugfix/login-error
fix/header-alignment

# Hotfix branches (urgent fixes)
hotfix/security-patch

# Release branches
release/v1.0.0
release/2024-01
```

### Best Practices

1. **Use lowercase** - `feature/login` not `Feature/Login`
2. **Use hyphens** - `feature-name` not `feature_name`
3. **Be descriptive** - `fix/user-login-timeout` not `fix/bug1`
4. **Include ticket numbers** - `feature/JIRA-123-user-profile`

## Common Branching Strategies

### 1. Git Flow

```
main ─────●─────────────────●───────●
           \               /        /
develop ────●────●────●───●────●───●
                  \      /
feature            ●────●
```

- `main` - Production code
- `develop` - Integration branch
- `feature/*` - New features
- `release/*` - Release preparation
- `hotfix/*` - Emergency fixes

### 2. GitHub Flow

```
main ────●────●────●────●────●
              \        /
feature        ●──●──●
```

Simpler workflow:
1. Branch from `main`
2. Make changes
3. Open Pull Request
4. Merge to `main`

### 3. Trunk-Based Development

```
main ────●────●────●────●────●
              \    /
feature        ●──●  (short-lived)
```

- Short-lived feature branches
- Merge frequently
- Feature flags for incomplete work

## Visualizing Branches

### Command Line

```bash
# Simple log with branches
git log --oneline --graph --all

# Example output:
* abc1234 (HEAD -> main) Latest commit
| * def5678 (feature) Feature work
|/
* 789abcd Previous commit
```

### GUI Tools

- **VS Code** - Built-in Git graph extensions

## Summary

Branches in Git:

- ✅ Allow parallel development
- ✅ Keep changes isolated
- ✅ Enable team collaboration
- ✅ Are just pointers (lightweight)
- ✅ Can be created/deleted easily

Next, let's learn how to create and switch between branches!
