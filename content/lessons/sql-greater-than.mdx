## The Greater Than Operator

The `>` operator finds values larger than a specified number.

## Syntax

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column > value;
```

## Example: High Achievers

Find students with marks above 80:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE marks > 80;
```

### Result

| id | name | marks | grade |
|----|------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Alice | 85 | A |
| 3 | Carol | 92 | A |
| 5 | Eve | 88 | A |

## More Examples

```sql
-- Students older than 13
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 13;

-- Marks above 90
SELECT name, marks FROM students WHERE marks > 90;

-- Age above 14
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 14;
```

## Combining Concepts

```sql
-- High achievers in specific columns
SELECT name, course, marks
FROM students
WHERE marks > 85;
```

## Greater Than with Strings

Works alphabetically:

```sql
-- Names after 'M' alphabetically
SELECT * FROM students WHERE name > 'M';
```

Returns names starting with N, O, P, etc.

## Key Points

1. `>` excludes the boundary value
2. `> 80` does NOT include 80
3. Works with numbers, dates, strings
