## The BETWEEN Operator

BETWEEN selects values within a range (inclusive).

## Syntax

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE column BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
```

## Example

Find students aged 12 to 14:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE age BETWEEN 12 AND 14;
```

This includes ages 12, 13, and 14.

## Equivalent To

```sql
-- BETWEEN is the same as:
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE age >= 12 AND age <= 14;
```

## With Numbers

```sql
-- Marks between 70 and 90
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE marks BETWEEN 70 AND 90;
```
