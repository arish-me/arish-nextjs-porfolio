## Exercise: Pushing Changes

Practice pushing commits to remote repositories.

## Prerequisites

- A repository with a remote configured
- Use your portfolio project from earlier tasks

---

## Exercise 1: Basic Push

### Task

Make a change and push it to the remote.

### Steps

```bash
cd portfolio-project

# Make a change
echo "/* Footer styles */" >> css/style.css
echo "footer { padding: 20px; }" >> css/style.css

# Stage and commit
git add css/style.css
git commit -m "Add footer styles"

# Push to remote
git push origin main

# Verify on GitHub
```

---

## Exercise 2: Check Before Pushing

### Task

Review what will be pushed before actually pushing.

### Steps

```bash
# Make changes
echo "// New utility function" >> js/main.js
git add js/main.js
git commit -m "Add utility function"

# See commits that will be pushed
git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline

# See diff that will be pushed
git diff origin/main..HEAD

# Now push
git push origin main
```

---

## Exercise 3: Push with Upstream

### Task

Create a new branch and push it with upstream tracking.

### Steps

```bash
# Create new branch
git checkout -b feature/contact-form

# Make changes
echo "<form>Contact Form</form>" >> index.html
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add contact form placeholder"

# Push with upstream (-u)
git push -u origin feature/contact-form

# Now you can just use 'git push' on this branch
echo "<!-- Updated -->" >> index.html
git add index.html
git commit -m "Update contact form"
git push  # No need to specify remote/branch
```

---

## Exercise 4: View Push Status

### Task

Check which branches need to be pushed.

### Steps

```bash
# See all branches with tracking status
git branch -vv

# Output shows tracking info:
# feature/contact-form abc1234 [origin/feature/contact-form] Update contact form
# * main               def5678 [origin/main] Add footer styles
```

---

## Exercise 5: Push After Local Changes

### Task

Make multiple commits locally, then push all at once.

### Steps

```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Make multiple commits
echo "/* Update 1 */" >> css/style.css
git add css/style.css
git commit -m "Style update 1"

echo "/* Update 2 */" >> css/style.css
git add css/style.css
git commit -m "Style update 2"

echo "/* Update 3 */" >> css/style.css
git add css/style.css
git commit -m "Style update 3"

# Check commits to push
git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline
# Shows 3 commits

# Push all at once
git push origin main
```

---

## Exercise 6: Handle Push Rejection (Simulated)

### Task

Understand what happens when push is rejected.

### Explanation

When your push is rejected:

```bash
git push origin main
# ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
# error: failed to push some refs
```

### Solution

```bash
# Pull first
git pull origin main

# Then push
git push origin main
```

If there are conflicts, you'll need to resolve them first.

---

## Exercise 7: Clean Up Feature Branch

### Task

After a feature branch is merged, clean up.

### Steps

```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Pull latest (includes merged feature)
git pull origin main

# Delete local feature branch
git branch -d feature/contact-form

# Delete remote feature branch
git push origin --delete feature/contact-form
```

---

## Challenge: Multi-Commit Push Workflow

### Task

Practice a realistic workflow with multiple commits.

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Start feature
git checkout -b feature/about-section

# 2. Add HTML structure
cat >> index.html << 'EOF'
<section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
</section>
EOF
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add about section HTML"

# 3. Add styles
cat >> css/style.css << 'EOF'
#about {
    padding: 2rem;
    background: #f5f5f5;
}
EOF
git add css/style.css
git commit -m "Add about section styles"

# 4. Push feature branch
git push -u origin feature/about-section

# 5. Verify on GitHub and create PR
```
