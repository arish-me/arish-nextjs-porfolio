In a future chapter, we will see why we are removing fixtures. For now, let's just go ahead and disable the fixtures.

To disable using fixtures open `test/test_helper.rb` and comment out the line shown below.

```ruby
# fixtures :all
```

Execute the following lines on the terminal to delete the fixtures folder completely:

```bash
rm -rf test/fixtures
```

### **Ensure fixtures won't get generated**

Rails provide several generator commands that help in generating boilerplate code for models, controllers, migration scripts, etc. We will be using them throughout the book.

But, with some of those generators, fixture files also get generated by default. We won't need those fixture files.

Fortunately, we can customize Rails generators to disable the auto-generation of fixtures for all the commands.

To do that, add the following lines in `config/application.rb`:

```ruby
require_relative 'boot'
require 'rails/all'

Bundler.require(*Rails.groups)

module Granite
  class Application < Rails::Application
    # previous code if any

    config.generators do |g|
      g.test_framework :test_unit, fixture: false
    end
  end
end
```

For simple applications, we can always rely on using `ActiveRecord` queries to create seed data for tests instead of fixtures. We will learn about them in the upcoming chapters.
