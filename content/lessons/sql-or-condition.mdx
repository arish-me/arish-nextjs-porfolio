## The OR Operator

OR combines conditions where ANY can be true.

## Syntax

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE condition1 OR condition2;
```

## Example

Find Python OR JavaScript students:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE course = 'Python'
OR course = 'JavaScript';
```

## How OR Works

| course = 'Python' | course = 'JavaScript' | Result |
|-------------------|----------------------|--------|
| True | True | ✅ Included |
| True | False | ✅ Included |
| False | True | ✅ Included |
| False | False | ❌ Excluded |

At least one must be true!

## Multiple ORs

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE course = 'Python'
OR course = 'JavaScript'
OR course = 'Ruby';
```
