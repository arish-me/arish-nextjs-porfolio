## Exercise: SELECT All Data

Practice retrieving all data from tables.

## Task 1: Get All Students

Write a query to retrieve all records from the `students` table.

### Solution

```sql
SELECT * FROM students;
```

## Task 2: Get All Courses

Write a query to retrieve all records from the `courses` table.

### Solution

```sql
SELECT * FROM courses;
```

## Task 3: Get All Teachers

Write a query to retrieve all records from the `teachers` table.

### Solution

```sql
SELECT * FROM teachers;
```

## Understanding the Output

When you run `SELECT *`:

1. All columns are returned
2. All rows are returned
3. Order matches table storage (unless specified)

## Common Mistakes

```sql
-- Missing FROM clause
SELECT * students;  -- Error!

-- Missing table name
SELECT * FROM;  -- Error!

-- Typo in table name
SELECT * FROM studnets;  -- Error!
```

## Key Takeaways

- `SELECT *` retrieves all columns
- Always specify the table with `FROM`
- Table names are case-sensitive in some databases
- End queries with semicolon
