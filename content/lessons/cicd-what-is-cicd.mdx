## Continuous Integration (CI)

Automatically build and test code on every push.

```
Code Push → Build → Test → Report
```

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

Automatically deploy after successful tests.

```
CI Pass → Deploy Staging → Deploy Production
```

## Benefits

- **Faster feedback** - Know if code breaks immediately
- **Reduced risk** - Small, frequent deployments
- **Consistency** - Same process every time
- **Quality** - Automated testing catches bugs

## CI/CD for Rails

```
Push → Install Dependencies → Run Tests → 
Lint Code → Security Scan → Build Image → Deploy
```

## Popular Tools

- GitHub Actions (we'll use this)
- GitLab CI
- CircleCI
- Jenkins
- Travis CI

## What We'll Build

A complete pipeline that:
1. Runs RSpec tests
2. Checks code with RuboCop
3. Scans for security issues
4. Builds Docker image
5. Deploys to production
