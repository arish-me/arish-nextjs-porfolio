## Installing Ruby on Rails

Now that Ruby is installed, let's install Rails. Rails is distributed as a Ruby gem, making installation straightforward.

## Install the Rails Gem

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
gem install rails
```

This installs the latest stable version of Rails along with all its dependencies.

### Installing a Specific Version

If you need a specific Rails version:

```bash
# Install Rails 7.1
gem install rails -v 7.1.0

# Install the latest Rails 7.x
gem install rails -v '~> 7.0'
```

## Verify the Installation

Check that Rails is installed correctly:

```bash
rails -v
# Output: Rails 7.1.3 (or your installed version)
```

## Additional Dependencies

Rails needs a few more tools to work properly:

### Node.js and Yarn

Rails uses Node.js for JavaScript processing and Yarn for package management:

```bash
# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install node yarn

# Ubuntu/Debian
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
npm install -g yarn

# Verify installation
node -v
yarn -v
```

### Database

Rails supports multiple databases. SQLite comes built-in for development:

```bash
# SQLite is usually pre-installed on macOS
sqlite3 --version

# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
```

For production, you'll likely want PostgreSQL:

```bash
# macOS
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev
sudo service postgresql start
```

## Create Your First Rails App

Let's test the installation by creating a new Rails application:

```bash
# Create a new Rails app
rails new my_first_app

# Navigate into the app directory
cd my_first_app

# Start the development server
rails server
```

Now open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the Rails welcome page!

## Understanding What Rails Generated

When you run `rails new`, it creates a complete application structure:

```
my_first_app/
├── app/                    # Your application code
│   ├── controllers/        # Handle HTTP requests
│   ├── models/             # Database models
│   ├── views/              # HTML templates
│   └── ...
├── config/                 # Configuration files
│   ├── routes.rb           # URL routing
│   └── database.yml        # Database settings
├── db/                     # Database files
│   ├── migrate/            # Database migrations
│   └── seeds.rb            # Seed data
├── Gemfile                 # Gem dependencies
└── ...
```

## Rails New Options

Customize your app when creating it:

```bash
# Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
rails new myapp --database=postgresql

# Skip Git initialization
rails new myapp --skip-git

# Use Tailwind CSS
rails new myapp --css=tailwind

# Skip Action Mailer
rails new myapp --skip-action-mailer

# API-only application (no views)
rails new myapp --api

# See all options
rails new --help
```

## Quick Development Tips

### Start the Server

```bash
rails server
# or shorthand
rails s
```

### Rails Console (Interactive Ruby with your app loaded)

```bash
rails console
# or
rails c
```

### Database Commands

```bash
# Create database
rails db:create

# Run migrations
rails db:migrate

# Seed the database
rails db:seed

# Reset database (drop, create, migrate, seed)
rails db:reset
```

You now have Rails installed and ready to build amazing web applications!
