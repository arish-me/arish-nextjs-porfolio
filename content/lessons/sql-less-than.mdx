## The Less Than Operator

The `<` operator finds values smaller than a specified number.

## Syntax

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column < value;
```

## Example: Young Students

Find students younger than 14:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE age < 14;
```

### Result

| id | name | age | course |
|----|------|-----|--------|
| 2 | Bob | 12 | JavaScript |
| 4 | David | 13 | Ruby |
| 5 | Eve | 12 | Python |

## More Examples

```sql
-- Marks below 70
SELECT * FROM students WHERE marks < 70;

-- Students under 13
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age < 13;

-- Marks below passing (60)
SELECT name, marks FROM students WHERE marks < 60;
```

## With Strings (Alphabetical Order)

Less than works alphabetically with strings:

```sql
-- Names before 'D' alphabetically
SELECT * FROM students WHERE name < 'D';
```

Returns: Alice, Bob, Carol (names starting with A, B, C)

## Key Points

1. `<` excludes the boundary value
2. Works with numbers, dates, and strings
3. For dates: earlier dates are "less than"

```sql
-- Orders before a date
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date < '2024-01-01';
```
