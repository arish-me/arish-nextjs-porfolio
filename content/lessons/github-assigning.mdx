## Assigning Issues and Pull Requests

Learn how to assign work to team members and manage responsibilities on GitHub.

## Assigning Issues

### Via GitHub Interface

1. Open an issue
2. Click **Assignees** in the right sidebar
3. Select team member(s)
4. They'll receive a notification

### Multiple Assignees

You can assign multiple people to one issue:

- Great for pair programming
- Useful for complex issues
- Shows shared responsibility

### Self-Assigning

When you start working on something:

1. Find an unassigned issue
2. Click **Assignees**
3. Click your name
4. Start working!

## Assigning Pull Requests

Same process as issues:

1. Open a PR
2. Click **Assignees**
3. Select the person responsible for merging

**Note**: Assignee ≠ Reviewer

- **Assignee**: Responsible for the PR
- **Reviewer**: Reviews the code

## Requesting Reviewers

### Add Reviewers to PR

1. Open your PR
2. Click **Reviewers** in sidebar
3. Select team members
4. They'll be notified to review

### Suggested Reviewers

GitHub suggests reviewers based on:

- Who owns the code (CODEOWNERS)
- Who recently modified the files
- Team membership

### CODEOWNERS File

Create `.github/CODEOWNERS`:

```
# Default owners
* @default-owner

# Frontend code
/src/components/ @frontend-team
*.css @design-team

# Backend code
/api/ @backend-team

# Documentation
/docs/ @docs-team
*.md @docs-team
```

Now PRs automatically request reviews from relevant owners.

## Managing Assignments

### Finding Your Work

```
# In search bar
is:open assignee:@me           # Issues assigned to you
is:open author:@me             # Issues you created
is:open mentions:@me           # Issues that mention you
review-requested:@me           # PRs needing your review
```

### Using GitHub Notifications

1. Click bell icon (🔔)
2. Filter by:
   - Assigned
   - Review requested
   - Mentioned

### Setting Up Email Notifications

Settings → Notifications → Email preferences

Configure notifications for:
- Assigned issues
- Review requests
- Mentions

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep Issues Assigned

```
# Good
Issue with clear assignee = clear ownership

# Bad
Issue with no assignee = nobody working on it
```

### 2. Don't Over-Assign

- One assignee per issue is usually enough
- Use multiple only when truly shared work

### 3. Reassign When Needed

If you can't complete something:

1. Remove yourself as assignee
2. Leave a comment explaining
3. Let someone else pick it up

### 4. Use Teams

For organizations:

1. Create teams (frontend, backend, etc.)
2. Assign to teams instead of individuals
3. Team members can self-assign

### 5. Review Response Time

Set expectations for review turnaround:

- Acknowledge review request within 24 hours
- Complete review within 48 hours
- Communicate delays

## Team Workflow Example

```
1. Issue created (unassigned)
   ↓
2. Team member self-assigns
   ↓
3. Creates branch and PR
   ↓
4. Requests reviews from teammates
   ↓
5. Reviews completed
   ↓
6. PR merged, issue closed
```

## Summary

Effective assignment helps teams:

- ✅ Know who's working on what
- ✅ Avoid duplicate work
- ✅ Track responsibilities
- ✅ Ensure issues don't get forgotten
- ✅ Speed up the review process
