## What is NULL?

NULL represents missing or unknown data. It's NOT the same as:
- Zero (0)
- Empty string ('')
- False

## NULL Behavior

```sql
-- These don't work with NULL:
NULL = NULL     -- Returns NULL, not true!
NULL != NULL    -- Returns NULL, not true!
```

## Why NULL is Special

NULL means "unknown value". You can't compare unknowns.

## Checking for NULL

Use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL:

```sql
-- Correct way
SELECT * FROM students WHERE phone IS NULL;

-- Wrong way (won't work!)
SELECT * FROM students WHERE phone = NULL;
```
