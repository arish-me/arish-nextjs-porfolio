## Renaming Branches

Sometimes you need to rename a branch - maybe there's a typo, or you want to follow a naming convention.

## Rename Current Branch

### Using -m Flag

```bash
# First, switch to the branch you want to rename
git checkout old-branch-name

# Rename the current branch
git branch -m new-branch-name
```

### Example

```bash
# You're on 'feture-login' (typo!)
git branch
# * feture-login

# Rename to fix the typo
git branch -m feature-login

# Verify
git branch
# * feature-login
```

## Rename a Different Branch

You can rename a branch you're not currently on:

```bash
# Rename any branch (don't need to be on it)
git branch -m old-name new-name
```

### Example

```bash
# You're on main, want to rename feature-1
git branch
# * main
#   feature-1

# Rename feature-1 to feature-user-auth
git branch -m feature-1 feature-user-auth

# Verify
git branch
# * main
#   feature-user-auth
```

## Force Rename

If a branch with the new name already exists, use `-M` (uppercase):

```bash
# Force rename (overwrites existing branch)
git branch -M old-name new-name
```

⚠️ **Warning**: This deletes the existing branch with that name!

## Rename Remote Branches

Renaming a remote branch requires a few steps:

### Step 1: Rename Local Branch

```bash
# Rename the local branch
git branch -m old-name new-name
```

### Step 2: Delete Old Remote Branch

```bash
# Delete the old branch on remote
git push origin --delete old-name
```

### Step 3: Push New Branch

```bash
# Push the renamed branch
git push origin new-name

# Set upstream
git push -u origin new-name
```

### Complete Example

```bash
# Rename local branch
git branch -m feature-old feature-new

# Delete old branch from GitHub
git push origin --delete feature-old

# Push new branch to GitHub
git push -u origin feature-new
```

## Rename main/master Branch

To rename the default branch:

### Local Rename

```bash
# Rename master to main
git branch -m master main
```

### Update Remote

```bash
# Push the new main branch
git push -u origin main

# Delete the old master branch
git push origin --delete master
```

### Update Default on GitHub

1. Go to repository Settings
2. Click on Branches
3. Change default branch to `main`
4. Then delete `master`

## Verify the Rename

After renaming, verify everything is correct:

```bash
# Check local branches
git branch

# Check remote branches
git branch -r

# Check tracking
git branch -vv
```

## Common Scenarios

### Fix a Typo

```bash
# Wrong: feture-login → Right: feature-login
git branch -m feture-login feature-login
```

### Follow Naming Convention

```bash
# Add prefix for consistency
git branch -m user-auth feature/user-auth
```

### Rename to Add Ticket Number

```bash
# Add JIRA ticket reference
git branch -m user-auth JIRA-123-user-auth
```

## Summary

Renaming branches:

- **Local current**: `git branch -m new-name`
- **Local other**: `git branch -m old-name new-name`
- **Force rename**: `git branch -M old-name new-name`
- **Remote**: Rename local, delete old remote, push new

Practice this in the next exercise!
