## Exercise: Exclude a Course

Find all students NOT enrolled in Ruby.

## Task

Select all students where course is not equal to 'Ruby'.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE course != 'Ruby';
```

Or using the alternative operator:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE course <> 'Ruby';
```

## Expected Output

All students except those in Ruby course.

| id | name | course |
|----|------|--------|
| 1 | Alice | Python |
| 2 | Bob | JavaScript |
| 3 | Carol | Python |
| ... | ... | ... |

## Practice More

```sql
-- Find students NOT in grade C
SELECT * FROM students WHERE grade != 'C';

-- Find students NOT aged 14
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age <> 14;

-- Find students with marks NOT equal to 78
SELECT * FROM students WHERE marks != 78;
```

## Combining Concepts

```sql
-- Select specific columns, exclude a course
SELECT name, age, marks
FROM students
WHERE course != 'Python';
```

## Summary

- `!=` and `<>` both mean "not equal"
- Works with strings, numbers, and dates
- NULL values need special handling (IS NULL)
