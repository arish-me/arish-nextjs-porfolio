## OFFSET Clause

OFFSET skips rows before returning results.

## Syntax

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5;
```

Skips first 5, returns next 5 (rows 6-10).

## Example: Ranks 6-10

```sql
SELECT name, marks FROM students
ORDER BY marks DESC
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5;
```

Top scorers ranked 6th to 10th.

## Alternative Syntax

```sql
-- LIMIT offset, count
SELECT * FROM students LIMIT 5, 5;
```
