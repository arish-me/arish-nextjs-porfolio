## SQL Comments

Comments help document your SQL code. They're ignored during execution.

## Single-Line Comments

Use `--` (two dashes):

```sql
-- This is a comment
SELECT * FROM students;

SELECT * FROM students; -- Get all students
```

## Example

```sql
-- Find all Python students
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE course = 'Python';
```

## Best Practices

- Explain complex logic
- Document table purposes
- Note query intentions
