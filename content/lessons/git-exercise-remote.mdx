## Exercise: Adding a Remote

Practice working with remote repositories.

## Setup

Use the portfolio project from Task 1, or create a new one:

```bash
mkdir remote-practice
cd remote-practice
git init
echo "# Remote Practice" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

---

## Exercise 1: View Existing Remotes

### Task

Check if any remotes are configured.

### Steps

```bash
# List remotes
git remote

# If empty, no output

# List with URLs
git remote -v

# Also empty if no remotes
```

---

## Exercise 2: Add a Remote

### Task

Add a remote called `origin`.

### Steps

```bash
# Add remote (use your own GitHub URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/remote-practice.git

# Verify
git remote -v

# Output:
# origin  https://github.com/your-username/remote-practice.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/your-username/remote-practice.git (push)
```

---

## Exercise 3: Add a Second Remote

### Task

Add a backup remote pointing to GitLab.

### Steps

```bash
# Add backup remote
git remote add backup https://gitlab.com/your-username/remote-practice.git

# View all remotes
git remote -v

# Output:
# backup  https://gitlab.com/your-username/remote-practice.git (fetch)
# backup  https://gitlab.com/your-username/remote-practice.git (push)
# origin  https://github.com/your-username/remote-practice.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/your-username/remote-practice.git (push)
```

---

## Exercise 4: Rename a Remote

### Task

Rename `origin` to `github`.

### Steps

```bash
# Rename remote
git remote rename origin github

# Verify
git remote -v

# Output now shows 'github' instead of 'origin'
```

---

## Exercise 5: Change Remote URL

### Task

Change the `github` remote from HTTPS to SSH.

### Steps

```bash
# Current URL (HTTPS)
git remote -v
# github  https://github.com/... (fetch)

# Change to SSH
git remote set-url github git@github.com:your-username/remote-practice.git

# Verify
git remote -v
# github  git@github.com:your-username/remote-practice.git (fetch)
```

---

## Exercise 6: View Remote Details

### Task

See detailed information about a remote.

### Steps

```bash
# Show remote details
git remote show github

# Output includes:
# - Fetch/Push URLs
# - HEAD branch
# - Remote branches
# - Tracking info
```

---

## Exercise 7: Remove a Remote

### Task

Remove the `backup` remote.

### Steps

```bash
# Remove remote
git remote remove backup

# Verify it's gone
git remote -v

# Only 'github' remains
```

---

## Exercise 8: Reset to Standard Setup

### Task

Rename `github` back to `origin` (standard convention).

### Steps

```bash
# Rename back to origin
git remote rename github origin

# Verify
git remote -v

# Standard setup:
# origin  git@github.com:your-username/remote-practice.git
```

---

## Challenge: Fork Workflow Setup

### Task

Set up a typical fork workflow with `origin` (your fork) and `upstream` (original).

### Steps

```bash
# Assuming you forked a repo and cloned your fork
# Your fork is already set as origin

# Add the original repo as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-author/original-repo.git

# Verify both remotes
git remote -v

# Output:
# origin    https://github.com/your-user/forked-repo.git (fetch)
# origin    https://github.com/your-user/forked-repo.git (push)
# upstream  https://github.com/original-author/original-repo.git (fetch)
# upstream  https://github.com/original-author/original-repo.git (push)
```

### Typical Fork Workflow

```bash
# Fetch from upstream (original repo)
git fetch upstream

# Merge upstream changes
git merge upstream/main

# Push to your fork
git push origin main
```

## Self-Check Questions

1. What command lists all remotes?
2. How do you add a new remote?
3. How do you change a remote's URL?
4. What's the difference between `origin` and `upstream`?

## Answers

1. `git remote` or `git remote -v`
2. `git remote add <name> <url>`
3. `git remote set-url <name> <new-url>`
4. `origin` is your repo, `upstream` is the original (for forks)

## Summary

You've practiced:

- ✅ Viewing remotes
- ✅ Adding remotes
- ✅ Renaming remotes
- ✅ Changing remote URLs
- ✅ Removing remotes
- ✅ Fork workflow setup
