## Exercise: Find Low Scores

Find all students with marks below 75.

## Task

Select all students where marks are less than 75.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE marks < 75;
```

## Expected Output

| id | name | marks | grade |
|----|------|-------|-------|
| 4 | David | 65 | C |
| 6 | Frank | 71 | B |
| 9 | Ivan | 58 | D |

## Practice Variations

```sql
-- Marks below 80
SELECT * FROM students WHERE marks < 80;

-- Age less than 13
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age < 13;

-- Show only names and marks
SELECT name, marks FROM students WHERE marks < 75;
```

## Combining with Other Clauses

```sql
-- Low scores, showing specific columns
SELECT name, course, marks
FROM students
WHERE marks < 75;
```

## Think About It

- Does `< 75` include 75? **No!**
- To include 75, you'd use `<= 75`

We'll learn about `<=` in the next chapter!
