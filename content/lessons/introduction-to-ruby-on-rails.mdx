## What is Ruby on Rails?

Ruby on Rails, often simply called Rails, is a powerful web application framework written in the Ruby programming language. Created by David Heinemeier Hansson in 2004, Rails follows the principle of "Convention over Configuration" - meaning it makes assumptions about what you need, so you can focus on building your app rather than setting up boilerplate code.

## Why Choose Rails?

Rails is perfect for building web applications quickly and efficiently. Here's why developers love it:

- **Fast Development**: Build features in hours, not days
- **Clean Code**: Ruby's elegant syntax makes code readable and maintainable
- **Batteries Included**: Everything you need comes built-in
- **Active Community**: Thousands of gems (libraries) available
- **Proven at Scale**: Used by GitHub, Shopify, Airbnb, and Basecamp

## The MVC Architecture

Rails follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern:

```ruby
# Model - Handles data and business logic
class User < ApplicationRecord
  validates :email, presence: true
end

# Controller - Processes requests and returns responses
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @user = User.find(params[:id])
  end
end

# View - Displays data to the user (in app/views/users/show.html.erb)
```

Think of it like a restaurant:
- **Model** = The kitchen (prepares the data)
- **Controller** = The waiter (takes orders, delivers food)
- **View** = The plate presentation (how it looks to the customer)

## Rails Philosophy

Rails is built on two main principles:

### 1. Convention over Configuration (CoC)
Instead of configuring everything manually, Rails uses sensible defaults:

```ruby
# Rails automatically knows:
# - Model 'User' uses table 'users'
# - Controller 'UsersController' serves views from 'app/views/users/'
# - URL '/users' maps to UsersController#index
```

### 2. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
Write code once, use it everywhere:

```ruby
# Instead of repeating validation logic everywhere,
# define it once in your model
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  validates :title, presence: true, length: { minimum: 5 }
  # This validation works everywhere automatically!
end
```

## What You'll Build

Throughout this course, you'll learn to build complete web applications with:

- User authentication and authorization
- Database models with relationships
- RESTful APIs
- File uploads with Active Storage
- Email notifications
- Background jobs
- And much more!

Let's get started by setting up your development environment.
