## Running SQL Queries

You can execute SQL queries using keyboard shortcuts for faster workflow.

## Common Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Execute Query | `Ctrl + Enter` or `Cmd + Enter` |
| Execute All | `Ctrl + Shift + Enter` |
| New Query | `Ctrl + N` |
| Save Query | `Ctrl + S` |

## SQL Query Structure

A basic SQL query follows this pattern:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

## Running Your First Query

```sql
-- Select all data from a table
SELECT * FROM students;
```

## Tips for Running Queries

1. **Always end with semicolon** - SQL statements end with `;`
2. **Test on small data** - Use LIMIT to test queries
3. **Check syntax** - SQL is case-insensitive but conventions help
4. **Read error messages** - They guide you to the issue

## Practice Environment

You can practice SQL using:

- **SQLite** - Lightweight, file-based
- **MySQL** - Popular open-source database
- **PostgreSQL** - Advanced features
- **Online playgrounds** - SQLFiddle, DB Fiddle
