## GitHub Pull Requests

Pull Requests (PRs) are how you propose changes and get them reviewed before merging into the main codebase.

## What is a Pull Request?

A PR lets you:

1. Show your changes to others
2. Get feedback through reviews
3. Discuss implementation
4. Run automated tests
5. Merge when approved

## Creating a Pull Request

### Step 1: Push Your Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push -u origin feature/new-feature
```

### Step 2: Open PR on GitHub

1. Go to your repository
2. Click **Pull requests** tab
3. Click **New pull request**
4. Select branches:
   - Base: `main` (merge into)
   - Compare: `feature/new-feature` (your changes)
5. Click **Create pull request**

### Step 3: Fill PR Details

- **Title**: Brief description

## PR Status Checks

### Automated Checks

- CI/CD tests (GitHub Actions)
- Code quality (linters)
- Security scans
- Coverage reports

### Required Checks

Configure in Settings → Branches:
- Require status checks to pass
- Require reviews before merging

## Updating a PR

### Add More Commits

```bash
# On your feature branch
git add .
git commit -m "Address review feedback"
git push
# PR automatically updates
```

### Respond to Reviews

- Reply to comments
- Mark conversations as resolved
- Request re-review after changes

## Merging a Pull Request

### Merge Options

1. **Create merge commit**
   - Preserves all commits
   - Adds merge commit

2. **Squash and merge**
   - Combines all commits into one
   - Cleaner history

3. **Rebase and merge**
   - Linear history
   - Replays commits on base

### After Merging

1. Delete the feature branch
2. Pull latest main locally:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git branch -d feature/new-feature
   ```

## PR Best Practices

### 1. Keep PRs Small

```
# Good: Focused PR
Add user login form (200 lines)

# Bad: Too large
Add entire auth system (2000 lines)
```

### 2. One PR = One Purpose

Don't mix unrelated changes.

### 3. Write Good Descriptions

Explain what, why, and how.

### 4. Include Tests

```bash
# Run tests before pushing
npm test
```

### 5. Respond Promptly

- Address feedback quickly
- Keep the PR moving

### 6. Use Draft PRs

For work in progress:

1. Create PR
2. Convert to draft
3. Mark ready when done
