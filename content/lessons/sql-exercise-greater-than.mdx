## Task

Select all students where age is greater than 13.

## Solution

```

## Expected Output

|----|------|-----|--------|
| 1 | Alice | 14 | Python |
| 3 | Carol | 15 | Python |
| 6 | Frank | 14 | HTML |

## Practice More

```sql
-- Marks above 85
SELECT * FROM students WHERE marks > 85;

-- Age above 12
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 12;

-- Only names of high scorers
SELECT name FROM students WHERE marks > 90;
```

## Challenge

Find students with marks above 80 and show only their name, course, and marks:

```sql
SELECT name, course, marks
