## Merging Pull Requests

Learn the different ways to merge PRs and when to use each method.

## Merge Options

GitHub offers three merge methods:

### 1. Create a Merge Commit

```
Before:
main:    A ─ B ─ C
              \
feature:       D ─ E

After merge commit:
main:    A ─ B ─ C ─────── M
              \           /
feature:       D ─ E ────
```

**Characteristics:**
- Preserves complete history
- Creates merge commit (M)
- Shows branch existed

**When to use:**
- Want full history
- Team prefers seeing branch structure

### 2. Squash and Merge

```
Before:
main:    A ─ B ─ C
              \
feature:       D ─ E ─ F

After squash:
main:    A ─ B ─ C ─ DEF
```

**Characteristics:**
- Combines all commits into one
- Clean, linear history
- Loses individual commit details

**When to use:**
- Feature had many WIP commits
- Want clean history
- Individual commits aren't important

### 3. Rebase and Merge

```
Before:
main:    A ─ B ─ C
              \
feature:       D ─ E

After rebase:
main:    A ─ B ─ C ─ D' ─ E'
```

**Characteristics:**
- Linear history
- Preserves individual commits
- Rewrites commit hashes

**When to use:**
- Want linear history
- Each commit is meaningful
- No merge commits needed

## How to Merge

### Basic Merge

1. Open PR
2. Verify all checks pass (green ✓)
3. Click **Merge pull request**
4. Choose merge method
5. Click **Confirm merge**
6. Click **Delete branch** (optional but recommended)

### Merge Requirements

Configure in Settings → Branches:

```
Branch protection rules:
☑ Require pull request reviews (1 approval)
☑ Require status checks to pass
☑ Require linear history
☑ Include administrators
```

## Handling Merge Conflicts

### When Conflicts Occur

GitHub shows: "This branch has conflicts that must be resolved"

### Resolve on GitHub

1. Click **Resolve conflicts**
2. Edit the file in the web editor
3. Remove conflict markers
4. Click **Mark as resolved**
5. Click **Commit merge**

### Resolve Locally

```bash
# Update your branch
git checkout feature-branch
git pull origin main

# Resolve conflicts in your editor
# Edit files, remove conflict markers

# Stage resolved files
git add .

# Complete the merge
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts with main"

# Push updated branch
git push origin feature-branch
```

## After Merging

### Delete Branch

```bash
# On GitHub: Click "Delete branch" button

# Locally:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature-branch
git fetch --prune
```

### Verify Merge

1. Check main branch has the changes
2. Verify deployment (if auto-deploy enabled)
3. Confirm issue is closed (if linked)

## Merge Best Practices

### 1. Always Review Before Merging

Even if you're the only reviewer:
- Check the diff
- Ensure tests pass
- Verify it works

### 2. Use Consistent Merge Strategy

Pick a strategy and stick with it:

| Team Preference | Strategy |
|-----------------|----------|
| Full history | Merge commit |
| Clean history | Squash |
| Linear history | Rebase |

### 3. Delete Branches After Merge

Keep repository clean:

```bash
# Configure auto-delete on GitHub
Settings → General → Automatically delete head branches ☑
```

### 4. Write Good Merge Commit Messages

For squash merges:

```
Add user authentication (#42)

- Implement login/logout
- Add session management
- Create login form UI

Co-authored-by: Partner <partner@email.com>
```

### 5. Don't Force Merge

If checks fail, fix them:

```
# Bad: Bypassing required checks
# Good: Fix the issue, then merge
```

## Reverting a Merge

If something goes wrong:

### Via GitHub

1. Go to PR (even after merged)
2. Click **Revert**
3. Creates new PR to undo changes
4. Merge the revert PR

### Via Command Line

```bash
git checkout main
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>
git push origin main
```

## Summary

| Method | History | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Merge commit | Complete | Want to see branches |
| Squash | Clean | Many WIP commits |
| Rebase | Linear | Each commit matters |

Choose based on your team's preferences and project needs!
