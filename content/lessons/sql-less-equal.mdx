## Less Than or Equal To

The `<=` operator includes the boundary value.

## Syntax

```sql
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age <= 14;
```

## Example

Find students aged 14 or younger:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE age <= 14;
```

This includes students who are exactly 14.

## Comparison

| Query | Includes 14? |
|-------|-------------|
| `age < 14` | No |
| `age <= 14` | Yes |

## More Examples

```sql
-- Marks up to 80 (including 80)
SELECT * FROM students WHERE marks <= 80;

-- Age 13 or below
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age <= 13;
```
