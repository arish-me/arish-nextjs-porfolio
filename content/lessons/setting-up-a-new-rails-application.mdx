Let's build a brand new Rails application. Rails offers us a command-line utility to build a brand new Rails application.

Run this command to generate a new Rails application with a specific Rails version:

```bash
rails _7.1.3.4_ new granite -j esbuild
```

It will produce a long output and might take some time to complete. It is downloading and setting up required files from the internet. Once it's finished, you can navigate to the root directory of your newly created `granite` project.

*We are aware that the latest version of Rails is 7.1.2. We will be updating the book soon. Whenever we update the book we need to ensure that the whole thing works fine. Hence it's taking some time.*
