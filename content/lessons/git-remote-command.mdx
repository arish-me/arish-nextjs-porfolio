## The git remote Command

The `git remote` command manages connections to remote repositories.

## View Remotes

### List Remote Names

```bash
git remote

# Output:
origin
```

### List with URLs

```bash
git remote -v

# Output:
origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)
```

## Add a Remote

### Basic Syntax

```bash
git remote add <name> <url>
```

### Example

```bash
# Add origin (most common name)
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/my-project.git

# Verify
git remote -v
```

### Multiple Remotes

You can have multiple remotes:

```bash
# Primary remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Backup remote
git remote add backup https://gitlab.com/user/repo.git

# Upstream (for forks)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/repo.git
```

## Remove a Remote

```bash
git remote remove <name>

# Example
git remote remove backup

# Verify
git remote -v
```

## Rename a Remote

```bash
git remote rename <old-name> <new-name>

# Example
git remote rename origin github

# Verify
git remote -v
```

## Change Remote URL

```bash
git remote set-url <name> <new-url>

# Example: Switch from HTTPS to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:user/repo.git

# Verify
git remote -v
```

## View Remote Details

```bash
git remote show <name>

# Example
git remote show origin

# Output:
* remote origin
  Fetch URL: https://github.com/user/repo.git
  Push  URL: https://github.com/user/repo.git
  HEAD branch: main
  Remote branches:
    develop tracked
    main    tracked
  Local branches configured for 'git pull':
    main merges with remote main
  Local refs configured for 'git push':
    main pushes to main (up to date)
```

## Common Remote Workflows

### Workflow 1: Clone and Push

```bash
# Clone sets up origin automatically
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
cd repo

# origin is already set
git remote -v
# origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)
```

### Workflow 2: Init and Add Remote

```bash
# Create local repo
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Push
git push -u origin main
```

### Workflow 3: Fork Workflow

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-user/repo.git
cd repo

# Add original repo as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-user/repo.git

# Now you have both:
git remote -v
# origin    https://github.com/your-user/repo.git (fetch/push)
# upstream  https://github.com/original-user/repo.git (fetch/push)
```

## Remote Prune

Clean up stale remote-tracking branches:

```bash
# Prune deleted remote branches
git remote prune origin

# Or during fetch
git fetch --prune
```
