## Why JOINs?

Tables are related. JOINs combine data from multiple tables.

## Example Tables

**students:** id, name, course_id
**courses:** id, course_name, instructor

## The Problem

```sql
-- Students table has course_id
-- Courses table has course details
-- How to combine them?
```

## The Solution: JOIN

```sql
SELECT students.name, courses.course_name
FROM students
JOIN courses ON students.course_id = courses.id;
```
