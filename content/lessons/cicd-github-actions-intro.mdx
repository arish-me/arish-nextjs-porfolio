## What is GitHub Actions?

CI/CD platform built into GitHub. Free for public repos.

## Key Concepts

- **Workflow** - Automated process (YAML file)
- **Job** - Set of steps that run on same runner
- **Step** - Individual task in a job
- **Action** - Reusable unit of code
- **Runner** - Server that runs workflows

## Your First Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: '3.2'
          bundler-cache: true
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: bundle exec rspec
```

## Workflow Triggers

```yaml
on:
  push:                    # On push
  pull_request:            # On PR
  schedule:                # Cron schedule
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:       # Manual trigger
```
