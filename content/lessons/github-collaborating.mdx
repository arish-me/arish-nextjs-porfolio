## Collaborating on GitHub

Learn how to give others access to your repositories.

## Adding Collaborators

2. Click **Collaborators** in sidebar
3. Click **Add people**
4. Enter username or email

They'll receive an invitation to accept.

## Permission Levels

| Admin | Full access, settings |

## Working with Teams

### Creating a Team

1. Go to Organization → Teams
2. Click **New team**
3. Name and describe
4. Add members
5. Add repositories

### Team Permissions

Assign entire team to repositories:

```
frontend-team → repo-name (Write)
backend-team → repo-name (Write)
```

## Fork Workflow

For open source or external contributors:

```
1. Contributor forks your repo
2. Makes changes in their fork
3. Opens PR to your repo
4. You review and merge
```

No direct access needed!

## Best Practices

1. **Least Privilege** - Give minimum needed access
2. **Use Teams** - Easier management
3. **Review Access Regularly** - Remove when not needed
4. **Use Branch Protection** - Require reviews
5. **Document Workflow** - CONTRIBUTING.md file

## Summary

- Add collaborators via Settings
- Choose appropriate permission levels
- Use teams for organizations
- Fork workflow for external contributors
