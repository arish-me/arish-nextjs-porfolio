## Essential Rails Commands

Rails provides powerful command-line tools that make development fast and efficient. Let's explore the most important commands you'll use daily.

## Server Commands

### Starting the Development Server

```bash
# Start the server on default port 3000
rails server
# Shorthand
rails s

# Start on a different port
rails s -p 4000

# Bind to all interfaces (useful in Docker)
rails s -b 0.0.0.0
```

### Rails Console

The console lets you interact with your application in real-time:

```bash
# Start the console
rails console
# Shorthand
rails c

# Start in sandbox mode (changes are rolled back)
rails c --sandbox
```

Inside the console:

```ruby
# Create a record
user = User.create(name: "John", email: "john@example.com")

# Query records
User.all
User.find(1)
User.where(active: true)

# Update a record
user.update(name: "Jane")

# Delete a record
user.destroy

# Reload the console (after code changes)
reload!
```

## Generator Commands

Generators create boilerplate code for you:

### Generate a Model

```bash
rails generate model Article title:string body:text published:boolean
# Shorthand
rails g model Article title:string body:text published:boolean
```

This creates:
- `app/models/article.rb` - The model file
- `db/migrate/xxx_create_articles.rb` - Database migration
- `test/models/article_test.rb` - Test file

### Generate a Controller

```bash
rails g controller Articles index show new create edit update destroy
```

This creates:
- `app/controllers/articles_controller.rb` - Controller with actions
- `app/views/articles/` - View templates for each action
- Routes (if using `--skip-routes` is not specified)
- Helper and test files

### Generate a Scaffold

Scaffolds generate a complete CRUD interface:

```bash
rails g scaffold Product name:string price:decimal description:text
```

This creates model, migration, controller, views, routes, and tests - everything for a complete CRUD feature!

### Generate a Migration

```bash
# Create a new table
rails g migration CreateProducts name:string price:decimal

# Add a column to existing table
rails g migration AddCategoryToProducts category:string

# Add an index
rails g migration AddIndexToProductsName

# Remove a column
rails g migration RemovePriceFromProducts price:decimal
```

### Other Useful Generators

```bash
# Generate a mailer
rails g mailer UserMailer welcome_email password_reset

# Generate a job
rails g job SendNewsletter

# Generate a channel (Action Cable)
rails g channel Notifications

# See all available generators
rails g --help
```

## Database Commands

### Creating and Managing Databases

```bash
# Create the database
rails db:create

# Drop the database
rails db:drop

# Run pending migrations
rails db:migrate

# Rollback the last migration
rails db:rollback

# Rollback multiple migrations
rails db:rollback STEP=3

# Check migration status
rails db:migrate:status

# Reset database (drop, create, migrate)
rails db:reset

# Seed the database
rails db:seed

# Setup database (create, migrate, seed)
rails db:setup
```

### Migration Shortcuts

```bash
# Migrate to a specific version
rails db:migrate VERSION=20240101000000

# Redo the last migration (rollback + migrate)
rails db:migrate:redo
```

## Route Commands

```bash
# Display all routes
rails routes

# Filter routes by controller
rails routes -c articles

# Filter routes by HTTP method
rails routes -g POST

# Show route for a specific path
rails routes | grep users
```

## Asset Commands

```bash
# Precompile assets for production
rails assets:precompile

# Clean old compiled assets
rails assets:clean

# Clobber (remove all compiled assets)
rails assets:clobber
```

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
rails test

# Run specific test file
rails test test/models/user_test.rb

# Run specific test by line number
rails test test/models/user_test.rb:15

# Run system tests
rails test:system
```

## Rake Tasks

```bash
# List all available tasks
rails -T

# List tasks matching a pattern
rails -T db

# Create a custom task
rails g task my_namespace my_task
```

Custom rake task example:

```ruby
# lib/tasks/maintenance.rake
namespace :maintenance do
  desc "Clean up old records"
  task cleanup: :environment do
    puts "Cleaning up old records..."
    Article.where('created_at < ?', 1.year.ago).destroy_all
    puts "Done!"
  end
end

# Run with: rails maintenance:cleanup
```

## Destroying Generated Files

Undo any generator command with `destroy`:

```bash
rails destroy model Article
rails destroy controller Articles
rails destroy scaffold Product
# Shorthand
rails d model Article
```

## Credentials Commands

```bash
# Edit credentials (opens in editor)
rails credentials:edit

# Edit environment-specific credentials
rails credentials:edit --environment production

# Show credential value
rails credentials:show
```

## Quick Reference Card

```bash
# Development
rails s                    # Start server
rails c                    # Console
rails routes               # Show routes

# Generators
rails g model Name         # Generate model
rails g controller Name    # Generate controller
rails g scaffold Name      # Generate scaffold
rails g migration Name     # Generate migration

# Database
rails db:create            # Create database
rails db:migrate           # Run migrations
rails db:rollback          # Undo last migration
rails db:seed              # Seed data
rails db:reset             # Reset database

# Testing
rails test                 # Run tests

# Cleanup
rails d model Name         # Destroy generated files
```

Master these commands, and you'll be navigating Rails like a pro!
