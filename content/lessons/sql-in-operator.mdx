## The IN Operator

IN matches values from a list - cleaner than multiple ORs.

## Syntax

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE column IN (value1, value2, value3);
```

## Example

Find Python, JavaScript, or Ruby students:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE course IN ('Python', 'JavaScript', 'Ruby');
```

## Equivalent To

```sql
-- IN is cleaner than:
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE course = 'Python'
OR course = 'JavaScript'
OR course = 'Ruby';
```

## With Numbers

```sql
-- Students aged 12, 14, or 15
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE age IN (12, 14, 15);
```
