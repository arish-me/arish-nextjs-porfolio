## Exercise: Switching Branches

Practice switching between branches and understanding how files change.

## Setup

Continue from the previous exercise, or create a fresh setup:

```bash
mkdir switch-practice
cd switch-practice
git init

# Create main with a file
echo "Main content" > main.txt
git add main.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit on main"

# Create feature-a with its own file
git checkout -b feature-a
echo "Feature A content" > feature-a.txt
git add feature-a.txt
git commit -m "Add feature A"

# Create feature-b with its own file
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature-b
echo "Feature B content" > feature-b.txt
git add feature-b.txt
git commit -m "Add feature B"
```

## Exercise 1: Basic Branch Switching

### Task

Switch between the three branches and observe file changes.

### Steps

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch

# List files
ls

# Switch to main
git checkout main
ls
# Only main.txt

# Switch to feature-a
git checkout feature-a
ls
# main.txt and feature-a.txt

# Switch to feature-b
git checkout feature-b
ls
# main.txt and feature-b.txt
```

### Observation

Notice how the files change as you switch branches!

---

## Exercise 2: Use git switch

### Task

Switch branches using the modern `git switch` command.

### Steps

```bash
# Switch to main
git switch main

# Switch to feature-a
git switch feature-a

# Try to switch to non-existent branch
git switch feature-xyz
# error: invalid reference: feature-xyz

# Verify current branch
git switch -
# Switches to previous branch (like cd -)
```

---

## Exercise 3: Switch with Uncommitted Changes

### Task

Understand what happens with uncommitted changes.

### Steps

```bash
# Go to feature-a
git checkout feature-a

# Make a change but don't commit
echo "Uncommitted work" >> feature-a.txt

# Try to switch branches
git checkout main
# Warning or error about uncommitted changes
```

### Solutions

```bash
# Option 1: Commit the changes
git add feature-a.txt
git commit -m "Update feature A"
git checkout main

# Option 2: Stash the changes
git stash
git checkout main
git checkout feature-a
git stash pop

# Option 3: Discard changes (careful!)
git checkout -- feature-a.txt
git checkout main
```

---

## Exercise 4: Quick Branch Switching

### Task

Learn shortcuts for switching between recent branches.

### Steps

```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Switch to feature-a
git checkout feature-a

# Switch back to previous branch (main)
git checkout -

# Switch back again (feature-a)
git checkout -
```

The `-` refers to the previously checked out branch.

---

## Exercise 5: Check Where You Are

### Task

Learn different ways to see your current branch.

### Steps

```bash
# Method 1: git branch (shows * next to current)
git branch

# Method 2: git status
git status
# On branch feature-a

# Method 3: git branch --show-current
git branch --show-current
# feature-a

# Method 4: Check HEAD
cat .git/HEAD
# ref: refs/heads/feature-a
```

---

## Exercise 6: Switch to Remote Branch

### Task

Switch to a branch that exists on remote (simulated).

### Steps

```bash
# First, create a "remote" branch locally for practice
git checkout main
git checkout -b origin/feature-remote
git checkout main

# Now pretend you want to track this remote branch
git checkout -b feature-remote origin/feature-remote
# Or simply:
git checkout feature-remote
```

In real scenarios:

```bash
# Fetch remote branches
git fetch origin

# Switch to remote branch (creates local tracking branch)
git checkout remote-branch-name
```

## Challenge: Branch Navigation

### Task

Navigate through this sequence correctly:

1. Start on `main`
2. Switch to `feature-a`
3. Go back to `main`
4. Switch to `feature-b`
5. Go to the previous branch
6. Create and switch to `feature-c`
7. Return to `main`

### Solution

```bash
git checkout main        # 1. Start on main
git checkout feature-a   # 2. Switch to feature-a
git checkout main        # 3. Go back to main
git checkout feature-b   # 4. Switch to feature-b
git checkout -           # 5. Previous branch (main)
git checkout -b feature-c # 6. Create and switch to feature-c
git checkout main        # 7. Return to main
```

## Quick Reference

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Switch branch | `git checkout branch` or `git switch branch` |
| Previous branch | `git checkout -` or `git switch -` |
| Current branch | `git branch --show-current` |
| List branches | `git branch` |

## Summary

You've practiced:

- ✅ Switching between branches
- ✅ Using `git checkout` and `git switch`
- ✅ Handling uncommitted changes
- ✅ Quick switching with `-`
- ✅ Checking current branch

Next, let's learn about renaming branches!
