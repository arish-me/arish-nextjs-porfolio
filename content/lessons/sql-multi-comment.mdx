## Multi-Line Comments

Use `/* */` for longer comments:

```sql
/*
  This query finds all students
  enrolled in Python course
  with marks above 80
*/
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE course = 'Python'
AND marks > 80;
```

## Inline Multi-Line

```sql
SELECT name, /* student name */ marks /* score */
FROM students;
```

## When to Use

- Complex query explanations
- Temporarily disabling code
- Documentation blocks
