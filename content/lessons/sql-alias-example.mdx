## Multiple Aliases

```sql
SELECT 
  name AS student_name,
  course AS enrolled_course,
  marks AS total_score
FROM students;
```

## With Functions

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_students FROM students;
```

## Without AS

AS is optional (but recommended for clarity):

```sql
SELECT name student_name FROM students;
```
