## What is Git?

Git is a **distributed version control system** that tracks changes in your code over time. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for developing the Linux kernel.

## Why Use Git?

### 1. Track Changes

Git keeps a complete history of every change made to your code:

```bash
# See the history of changes
git log

# Output shows all commits with dates and authors
commit a1b2c3d4e5f6...
Author: John Doe <john@example.com>
Date:   Mon Jan 15 10:30:00 2024

    Added user authentication feature
```

### 2. Collaborate with Others

Multiple developers can work on the same project:

```bash
# Get changes from teammates
git pull

# Share your changes
git push
```

### 3. Experiment Safely

Create branches to try new ideas without affecting the main code:

```bash
# Create a new branch for experiments
git checkout -b experiment-feature

# If it works, merge it. If not, delete it!
```

### 4. Recover from Mistakes

Made a mistake? Git lets you go back:

```bash
# Undo the last commit
git revert HEAD

# Go back to a specific point in time
git checkout a1b2c3d
```

## Git vs Other Version Control Systems

| Feature | Git | SVN | CVS |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|
| Distributed | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Branching | Fast | Slow | Slow |
| Offline Work | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Speed | Fast | Medium | Slow |

## Key Concepts

### Repository (Repo)

A repository is a folder tracked by Git. It contains:

- Your project files
- A hidden `.git` folder with history

### Commit

A commit is a snapshot of your code at a specific point in time:

```bash
git commit -m "Added login feature"
```

### Branch

A branch is an independent line of development:

```
main ──●──●──●──●──●
              \
feature        ●──●──●
```

### Remote

A remote is a copy of your repository on a server (like GitHub):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

## The Git Workflow

1. **Modify** files in your working directory
2. **Stage** changes you want to commit
3. **Commit** staged changes to your local repository
4. **Push** commits to a remote repository

```
Working Directory → Staging Area → Local Repo → Remote Repo
      (edit)         (git add)    (git commit)   (git push)
```

## Who Uses Git?

Git is used by:

- 🏢 Tech giants (Google, Microsoft, Facebook)
- 🚀 Startups
- 📦 Open source projects
- 👩‍💻 Individual developers
- 📚 Students learning to code

## Summary

Git is essential for modern software development because it:

- Tracks all changes to your code
- Enables collaboration
- Provides safety through branching
- Allows recovery from mistakes

In the next lesson, we'll explore the Git workflow in more detail.
