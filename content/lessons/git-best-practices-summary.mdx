## Best Practices for Git and GitHub

A comprehensive guide to professional Git and GitHub workflows.

## Commit Best Practices

### Write Good Commit Messages

```bash
# Format
<type>: <subject>

<body>

# Examples
feat: Add user authentication
fix: Resolve login timeout issue
docs: Update API documentation
refactor: Simplify validation logic
```

### Commit Often, Commit Small

```bash
# Good: Focused commits
git commit -m "Add user model"
git commit -m "Add user controller"
git commit -m "Add user routes"

# Bad: Giant commits
git commit -m "Add entire user system"
```

### Use Present Tense

```bash
# Good
git commit -m "Add feature"

# Avoid
git commit -m "Added feature"
```

## Branch Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

```
feature/user-authentication
bugfix/login-error
hotfix/security-patch
release/v1.0.0
```

### Keep Branches Short-Lived

- Merge within days, not weeks
- Regularly sync with main
- Delete after merging

### Protect Main Branch

```
Settings → Branches → Add rule:
☑ Require pull request
☑ Require reviews
☑ Require status checks
```

## Pull Request Best Practices

### Keep PRs Small

- Under 400 lines when possible
- Single purpose
- Easier to review

### Write Good Descriptions

```markdown
## What
Brief description

## Why
Reason for change

## How
Implementation details

## Testing
How to test

Closes #123
```

### Request Appropriate Reviews

- 1-2 reviewers usually enough
- Use CODEOWNERS for automation

## Repository Best Practices

### Essential Files

```
README.md           # Project overview
LICENSE             # Usage terms
.gitignore          # Ignored files
CONTRIBUTING.md     # How to contribute
CHANGELOG.md        # Version history
```

### Use Issues and Projects

- Track all work in issues
- Use project boards
- Link PRs to issues

### Automate with Actions

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm test
```

## Security Best Practices

### Never Commit Secrets

```gitignore
# .gitignore
.env
*.pem
secrets/
```

### Use Environment Variables

```bash
# Not in code
DB_PASSWORD=secret

# In code
process.env.DB_PASSWORD
```

### Enable Security Features

- Dependabot alerts
- Code scanning
- Secret scanning

## Team Workflow

### Standard Flow

```
1. Create issue
2. Create branch from main
3. Make changes
4. Open PR
5. Get reviews
6. Merge to main
7. Delete branch
```

### Stay Synchronized

```bash
# Daily routine
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout my-feature
git rebase main
```

## Common Git Commands Cheatsheet

```bash
# Setup
git init
git clone <url>
git config --global user.name "Name"

# Daily Work
git status
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin branch

# Branching
git checkout -b branch
git switch branch
git merge branch
git branch -d branch

# Remote
git remote -v
git fetch origin
git pull origin main
git push origin branch

# History
git log --oneline
git diff
git show commit

# Undo
git reset HEAD~1
git revert commit
git stash
```

## Summary

### Golden Rules

1. **Commit often** with clear messages
2. **Branch** for every feature
3. **Review** all code through PRs
4. **Never** commit secrets
5. **Automate** testing and deployment
6. **Document** your project
