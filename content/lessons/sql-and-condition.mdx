## The AND Operator

AND combines multiple conditions. ALL conditions must be true.

## Syntax

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
```

## Example

Find Python students with marks above 80:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE course = 'Python'
AND marks > 80;
```

## How AND Works

| course = 'Python' | marks > 80 | Result |
|-------------------|------------|--------|
| True | True | ✅ Included |
| True | False | ❌ Excluded |
| False | True | ❌ Excluded |
| False | False | ❌ Excluded |

Both must be true!

## Multiple ANDs

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE course = 'Python'
AND marks > 80
AND age > 12;
```
