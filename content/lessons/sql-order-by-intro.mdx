## ORDER BY Clause

ORDER BY sorts results.

## Syntax

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY column;
```

## Example: Sort by Marks

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY marks;
```

Sorts from lowest to highest (ascending by default).

## Multiple Columns

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY grade, marks;
```

First by grade, then by marks within each grade.
