## Exercise: Creating Branches

Practice creating branches in different scenarios.

## Setup

First, create a practice repository:

```bash
# Create and initialize
mkdir branch-practice
cd branch-practice
git init

# Create initial commit
echo "# Branch Practice" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

---

## Exercise 1: Create a Simple Branch

### Task

Create a branch called `feature-header`.

### Steps

```bash
# Create the branch
git branch feature-header

# Verify it was created
git branch
```

### Expected Output

```
  feature-header
* main
```

---

## Exercise 2: Create and Switch to a Branch

### Task

Create a branch called `feature-footer` and switch to it.

### Steps

```bash
# Create and switch in one command
git checkout -b feature-footer

# Verify you're on the new branch
git branch
```

### Expected Output

```
  feature-header
* feature-footer
  main
```

---

## Exercise 3: Make Changes on a Branch

### Task

While on `feature-footer`, add a file and commit.

### Steps

```bash
# Ensure you're on feature-footer
git checkout feature-footer

# Create a file
echo "<footer>Copyright 2024</footer>" > footer.html

# Stage and commit
git add footer.html
git commit -m "Add footer component"

# Verify the commit
git log --oneline
```

### Expected Output

```
abc1234 (HEAD -> feature-footer) Add footer component
def5678 (main, feature-header) Initial commit
```

---

## Exercise 4: Create Branch from Another Branch

### Task

Create `feature-footer-social` from `feature-footer`.

### Steps

```bash
# Ensure you're on feature-footer
git checkout feature-footer

# Create new branch from current branch
git checkout -b feature-footer-social

# Verify the branch hierarchy
git log --oneline --graph --all
```

### Expected Output

```
* abc1234 (HEAD -> feature-footer-social, feature-footer) Add footer component
* def5678 (main, feature-header) Initial commit
```

---

## Exercise 5: Create Multiple Feature Branches

### Task

From `main`, create three branches for different features.

### Steps

```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Create multiple branches
git branch feature-about
git branch feature-contact
git branch feature-services

# List all branches
git branch
```

### Expected Output

```
  feature-about
  feature-contact
  feature-footer
  feature-footer-social
  feature-header
  feature-services
* main
```

---

## Exercise 6: Use git switch (Modern Syntax)

### Task

Use `git switch` to create and switch to a new branch.

### Steps

```bash
# Create and switch using modern syntax
git switch -c feature-gallery

# Verify
git branch --show-current
```

### Expected Output

```
feature-gallery
```

---

## Challenge Exercise

### Task

Create a branch structure for a team project:

1. Create `develop` branch from `main`
2. From `develop`, create:
   - `feature/user-auth`
   - `feature/dashboard`
   - `feature/settings`
3. Add a commit to each feature branch

### Solution

```bash
# Start from main
git checkout main

# Create develop branch
git checkout -b develop

# Create feature branches from develop
git checkout -b feature/user-auth develop
echo "Auth module" > auth.js
git add auth.js
git commit -m "Add auth module"

git checkout -b feature/dashboard develop
echo "Dashboard" > dashboard.js
git add dashboard.js
git commit -m "Add dashboard"

git checkout -b feature/settings develop
echo "Settings" > settings.js
git add settings.js
git commit -m "Add settings"

# View the branch structure
git log --oneline --graph --all
```

---

## Self-Check

Verify your work:

```bash
# List all branches
git branch

# View branch relationships
git log --oneline --graph --all
```

You should have branches organized logically with their own commits.

## Summary

You've practiced:

- ✅ Creating branches with `git branch`
- ✅ Creating and switching with `git checkout -b`
- ✅ Using modern `git switch -c`
- ✅ Creating branches from other branches
- ✅ Managing multiple feature branches

Great work! Next, let's practice switching between branches.
