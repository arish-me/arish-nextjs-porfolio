## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories. It's the world's largest code hosting platform with over 100 million developers.

## Git vs GitHub

| Version control system | Hosting platform |
| Installed on your computer | Accessed via web |
| Command-line tool | Web interface + API |
