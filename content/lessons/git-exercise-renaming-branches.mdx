## Exercise: Renaming Branches

Practice renaming branches in various scenarios.

## Setup

```bash
mkdir rename-practice
cd rename-practice
git init

echo "# Rename Practice" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Create branches with "mistakes"
git branch feture-login      # Typo
git branch feature1          # No description
git branch my-branch         # Not following convention
git branch user-profile      # Missing prefix
```

---

## Exercise 1: Fix a Typo

### Task

Rename `feture-login` to `feature-login`.

### Steps

```bash
# Rename from anywhere
git branch -m feture-login feature-login

# Verify
git branch
```

### Expected Output

```
  feature-login
  feature1
* main
  my-branch
  user-profile
```

---

## Exercise 2: Add Description to Branch Name

### Task

Rename `feature1` to `feature-payment-gateway`.

### Steps

```bash
# Rename the branch
git branch -m feature1 feature-payment-gateway

# Verify
git branch
```

---

## Exercise 3: Rename Current Branch

### Task

Switch to `my-branch` and rename it to `feature-navigation`.

### Steps

```bash
# Switch to the branch
git checkout my-branch

# Rename current branch (no old name needed)
git branch -m feature-navigation

# Verify
git branch
```

### Expected Output

```
  feature-login
* feature-navigation
  feature-payment-gateway
  main
  user-profile
```

---

## Exercise 4: Add Prefix to Branch

### Task

Rename `user-profile` to `feature/user-profile` following Git Flow convention.

### Steps

```bash
# Rename with prefix
git branch -m user-profile feature/user-profile

# Verify
git branch
```

---

## Exercise 5: Rename Multiple Branches

### Task

Standardize all feature branches to use `feature/` prefix.

### Steps

```bash
# Rename each branch
git branch -m feature-login feature/login
git branch -m feature-navigation feature/navigation
git branch -m feature-payment-gateway feature/payment-gateway

# Verify all branches
git branch
```

### Expected Output

```
  feature/login
  feature/navigation
  feature/payment-gateway
  feature/user-profile
* main
```

---

## Exercise 6: Handle Existing Name Conflict

### Task

Try to rename a branch to a name that already exists.

### Steps

```bash
# Create a branch
git branch temp-feature

# Try to rename to existing branch
git branch -m temp-feature feature/login
# Error: A branch named 'feature/login' already exists

# Force rename (this will delete the old feature/login!)
# git branch -M temp-feature feature/login

# Better: Choose a different name
git branch -m temp-feature feature/temp

# Verify
git branch
```

---

## Challenge: Complete Branch Reorganization

### Task

Reorganize branches to follow this convention:
- Features: `feature/description`
- Bugfixes: `bugfix/description`
- Hotfixes: `hotfix/description`

### Setup

```bash
# Create branches to reorganize
git branch login-fix
git branch urgent-security-patch
git branch new-dashboard
git branch fix-header-bug
```

### Solution

```bash
# Rename feature branch
git branch -m new-dashboard feature/dashboard

# Rename bugfix branches
git branch -m login-fix bugfix/login
git branch -m fix-header-bug bugfix/header

# Rename hotfix branch
git branch -m urgent-security-patch hotfix/security-patch

# Verify
git branch
```

### Expected Output

```
  bugfix/header
  bugfix/login
  feature/dashboard
  feature/login
  feature/navigation
  feature/payment-gateway
  feature/temp
  feature/user-profile
  hotfix/security-patch
* main
```

## Self-Check Questions

1. What flag is used to rename a branch?
2. How do you rename the current branch?
3. How do you rename a branch you're not on?
4. What does `-M` (uppercase) do?

## Answers

1. `-m` flag: `git branch -m new-name`
2. Just: `git branch -m new-name` (no old name needed)
3. `git branch -m old-name new-name`
4. Force rename (overwrites existing branch)
