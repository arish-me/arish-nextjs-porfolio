## Not Equal Operator

To find records that DON'T match a value, use `!=` or `<>`.

## Syntax

```sql
-- Using !=
SELECT * FROM students WHERE course != 'Python';

-- Using <> (ANSI standard)
SELECT * FROM students WHERE course <> 'Python';
```

Both operators work the same way.

## Example: Non-Python Students

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE course != 'Python';
```

### Result

| id | name | age | course | marks |
|----|------|-----|--------|-------|
| 2 | Bob | 12 | JavaScript | 78 |
| 4 | David | 13 | Ruby | 65 |
| 6 | Frank | 14 | HTML | 71 |

## More Examples

```sql
-- Students not in grade A
SELECT * FROM students WHERE grade != 'A';

-- Students not aged 12
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age != 12;

-- Students with marks not equal to 85
SELECT * FROM students WHERE marks <> 85;
```

## != vs <>

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `!=` | Common, widely supported |
| `<>` | ANSI SQL standard |

Both are correct. Choose one and be consistent.

## Important Note

Not equal does NOT match NULL values:

```sql
-- This won't return rows where course IS NULL
SELECT * FROM students WHERE course != 'Python';
```

To include NULLs, use IS NULL separately (covered later).
