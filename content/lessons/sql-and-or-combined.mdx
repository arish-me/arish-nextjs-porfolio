## Using AND and OR Together

Use parentheses to group conditions correctly.

## The Problem

```sql
-- Ambiguous without parentheses
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE course = 'Python' OR course = 'JavaScript'
AND marks > 80;
```

## The Solution: Parentheses

```sql
-- Clear intention
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE (course = 'Python' OR course = 'JavaScript')
AND marks > 80;
```

## Operator Precedence

AND is evaluated before OR. Use parentheses to be explicit.

## Example

High-scoring Python or JavaScript students:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE (course = 'Python' OR course = 'JavaScript')
AND marks > 80;
```
