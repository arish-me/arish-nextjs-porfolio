## Exercise: Find JavaScript Students

Write a query to find all students enrolled in the JavaScript course.

## Task

Select all students where the course is 'JavaScript'.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE course = 'JavaScript';
```

## Expected Output

| id | name | age | course | marks | grade |
|----|------|-----|--------|-------|-------|
| 2 | Bob | 12 | JavaScript | 78 | B |
| 7 | Grace | 11 | JavaScript | 82 | B |

## Understanding the Query

1. `SELECT *` - Get all columns
2. `FROM students` - From the students table
3. `WHERE course = 'JavaScript'` - Only JavaScript students

## Try These Variations

```sql
-- Find Ruby students
SELECT * FROM students WHERE course = 'Ruby';

-- Find Python students
SELECT * FROM students WHERE course = 'Python';

-- Find HTML students
SELECT * FROM students WHERE course = 'HTML';
```

## Common Errors

```sql
-- Missing quotes around string
SELECT * FROM students WHERE course = JavaScript;  -- Error!

-- Wrong operator
SELECT * FROM students WHERE course == 'JavaScript';  -- Error in SQL!
```

Remember: SQL uses single `=` for comparison, not `==`.
