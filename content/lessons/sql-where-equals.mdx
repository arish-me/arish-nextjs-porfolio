## The WHERE Clause

The WHERE clause filters records based on conditions.

## Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

## Filter by Exact Match

Find all students enrolled in Python:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE course = 'Python';
```

### Result

| id | name | age | course | marks |
|----|------|-----|--------|-------|
| 1 | Alice | 14 | Python | 85 |
| 3 | Carol | 15 | Python | 92 |

## Comparison with Equals

The `=` operator checks for exact matches:

```sql
-- Filter by course
SELECT * FROM students WHERE course = 'Python';

-- Filter by grade
SELECT * FROM students WHERE grade = 'A';

-- Filter by age
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age = 14;
```

## String vs Number Comparisons

```sql
-- Strings need quotes
SELECT * FROM students WHERE name = 'Alice';

-- Numbers don't need quotes
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age = 14;

-- But this also works (not recommended)
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age = '14';
```

## Case Sensitivity

Depending on your database:

```sql
-- May or may not match 'Python'
SELECT * FROM students WHERE course = 'python';
```

- **MySQL**: Case-insensitive by default
- **PostgreSQL**: Case-sensitive
- **SQLite**: Case-insensitive for ASCII

## Key Points

1. WHERE filters rows before returning results
2. Use `=` for exact matches
3. Strings require quotes, numbers don't
4. Case sensitivity depends on database
