## Exercise: Ending Pattern

Find students whose names end with 'n'.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE name LIKE '%n';
```

## Single Character Wildcard

The underscore `_` matches exactly one character:

```sql
-- Names with 4 characters
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE name LIKE '____';
```
