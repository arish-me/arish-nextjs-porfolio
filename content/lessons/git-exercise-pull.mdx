## Exercise: Pulling Changes

Practice pulling changes from remote repositories.

## Setup

For these exercises, you'll simulate having changes on remote by editing files directly on GitHub.

---

## Exercise 1: Make Remote Change on GitHub

### Task

Create a change directly on GitHub to pull down.

### Steps

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on `README.md`
3. Click the pencil icon (Edit)
4. Add a line: `## Updated on GitHub`
5. Commit directly to main

### Now Pull Locally

```bash
cd portfolio-project

# Check current status
git status

# Pull the changes
git pull origin main

# Verify the change
cat README.md
# Should show "## Updated on GitHub"
```

---

## Exercise 2: Fetch vs Pull

### Task

Understand the difference between fetch and pull.

### Make Another GitHub Change

1. On GitHub, edit `README.md`
2. Add another line: `### This is a fetch test`
3. Commit to main

### Fetch (Download Only)

```bash
# Fetch without merging
git fetch origin

# Your local file is unchanged
cat README.md
# Doesn't show the new line yet

# See what was fetched
git log HEAD..origin/main --oneline
# Shows the new commit

# See the diff
git diff HEAD..origin/main

# Now merge when ready
git merge origin/main

# Verify
cat README.md
```

---

## Exercise 3: Pull with Local Changes

### Task

Pull when you have uncommitted local changes.

### Make Local Uncommitted Change

```bash
echo "Local work in progress" >> notes.txt
```

### Try to Pull

```bash
git pull origin main
# May warn about uncommitted changes
```

### Solution: Use Stash

```bash
# Stash local changes
git stash

# Now pull
git pull origin main

# Restore local changes
git stash pop

# Check status
git status
```

---

## Exercise 4: Pull with Committed Changes

### Task

Pull when remote and local both have commits.

### Setup

1. Make a local commit:
```bash
echo "// Local feature" >> js/main.js
git add js/main.js
git commit -m "Add local feature"
```

2. On GitHub, edit another file (e.g., add comment to style.css)
3. Commit on GitHub

### Pull

```bash
# Pull will merge remote changes
git pull origin main

# Git creates a merge commit
# View the merge
git log --oneline --graph -5
```

---

## Exercise 5: Pull with Rebase

### Task

Use rebase instead of merge when pulling.

### Setup

1. Make a local commit:
```bash
echo "// Another local change" >> js/main.js
git add js/main.js
git commit -m "Add another local change"
```

2. Make a change on GitHub to a different file

### Pull with Rebase

```bash
# Pull with rebase
git pull --rebase origin main

# Your commit is replayed on top
git log --oneline -5
# History is linear, no merge commit
```

---

## Exercise 6: Handle Pull Conflict

### Task

Resolve a conflict during pull.

### Create Conflicting Changes

1. Locally, edit line 1 of README.md:
```bash
# Edit README.md - change the title
sed -i '' '1s/.*/# My Awesome Portfolio/' README.md  # Mac
# or manually edit the first line
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update local title"
```

2. On GitHub, edit the SAME line differently
   - Change first line to "# My GitHub Portfolio"
   - Commit on GitHub

### Pull and Resolve

```bash
git pull origin main
# CONFLICT!

# Check status
git status
# both modified: README.md

# Open README.md and resolve
# Remove conflict markers, keep what you want

# Complete the merge
git add README.md
git commit -m "Resolve README title conflict"

# Push the resolution
git push origin main
```

---

## Exercise 7: Configure Default Pull Behavior

### Task

Set up your preferred pull behavior.

### Option 1: Always Rebase

```bash
# Global setting
git config --global pull.rebase true

# Now 'git pull' uses rebase by default
```

### Option 2: Always Merge

```bash
git config --global pull.rebase false
```

### Option 3: Fast-Forward Only

```bash
git config --global pull.ff only
# Fails if can't fast-forward
```
