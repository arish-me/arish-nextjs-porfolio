## The AS Keyword

AS gives a column a temporary name (alias).

## Syntax

```sql
SELECT column AS alias_name FROM table;
```

## Example

```sql
SELECT name AS student_name FROM students;
```

### Result

| student_name |
|--------------|
| Alice |
| Bob |

## Why Use Aliases?

- More readable column names
- Required for calculated columns
- Shorter names for long columns
