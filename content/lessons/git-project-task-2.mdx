## Project Task 2: Working with Remotes

Continue building your portfolio project by mastering remote management.

## Objective

Configure multiple remotes and understand different URL formats.

## Prerequisites

You should have completed Task 1 with your portfolio project.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Verify Current Remote

```bash
cd portfolio-project

# Check current remote
git remote -v

# Should show:
# origin  https://github.com/username/portfolio-project.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/username/portfolio-project.git (push)
```

### Step 2: View Remote Details

```bash
git remote show origin

# Note the information displayed:
# - Fetch/Push URLs
# - HEAD branch
# - Remote branches
```

### Step 3: Add SSH Remote (Alternative Access)

```bash
# Add same repo with SSH URL as alternate
git remote add github-ssh git@github.com:username/portfolio-project.git

# Verify both
git remote -v

# Output:
# github-ssh  git@github.com:username/portfolio-project.git (fetch)
# github-ssh  git@github.com:username/portfolio-project.git (push)
# origin      https://github.com/username/portfolio-project.git (fetch)
# origin      https://github.com/username/portfolio-project.git (push)
```

### Step 4: Understand When to Use Each

**HTTPS (`origin`):**
- Works through firewalls
- Requires credentials/token
- Good for beginners

**SSH (`github-ssh`):**
- No password prompts
- Requires SSH key setup
- Preferred for regular use

### Step 5: Switch Primary Remote to SSH

If you've set up SSH keys:

```bash
# Change origin to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/portfolio-project.git

# Remove the extra remote
git remote remove github-ssh

# Verify
git remote -v
```

### Step 6: Make and Push Changes

```bash
# Add new section to index.html
cat >> index.html << 'EOF'
        <section id="projects">
            <h2>My Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Portfolio Website</li>
                <li>More coming soon...</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
EOF

# Stage and commit
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add projects section"

# Push to remote
git push origin main
```

### Step 7: Verify on GitHub

1. Visit your repository on GitHub
2. Check that the new commit appears
3. View the updated index.html file

## Bonus: Add a Mirror Remote

For backup purposes, you can push to multiple remotes:

```bash
# Add a GitLab mirror (optional)
# First create repo on GitLab, then:
git remote add gitlab https://gitlab.com/username/portfolio-project.git

# Push to both
git push origin main
git push gitlab main
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Remote shows correct URL
- [ ] Can view remote details with `git remote show`
- [ ] Changes pushed successfully
- [ ] Commits visible on GitHub

## Common Issues

### Authentication Failed

```bash
# For HTTPS, use a Personal Access Token
# GitHub → Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens

# Or switch to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git
```

### Remote Already Exists

```bash
# Remove and re-add
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin <correct-url>

# Or just update URL
git remote set-url origin <correct-url>
```
