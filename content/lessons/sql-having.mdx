## HAVING Clause

Filter groups (like WHERE but for aggregates).

```sql
SELECT course, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM students
GROUP BY course
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
```

Only courses with more than 3 students.

## WHERE vs HAVING

- WHERE: Filters rows before grouping
- HAVING: Filters groups after grouping
