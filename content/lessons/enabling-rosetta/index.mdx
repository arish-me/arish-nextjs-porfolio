## Enabling Rosetta for Terminal on M1 Mac

If `Rosetta 2` is not installed by default in your M1 Mac, then open the pre-installed `Terminal` app and run the following command:

```bash
/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
```

Rosetta allows us to use apps built for Mac with intel chip.

Several CLI tools do not have native versions built for the new M1 architecture.

Enabling them on your native M1 Mac terminal can be frustrating.

Follow these steps to enable Rosetta:

- Select the app(Terminal) in the Finder. Note that the "Terminal app" could be at "Applications/Utilities".
- Right click on the app(Terminal) and select `Get Info`.
- In `General`, check the `Open using Rosetta` check-box.
- Close the Terminal Info.
- Now when you quit the terminal and open it again.

## Installing Homebrew

After enabling Rosetta, let's install Homebrew:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

This will install Homebrew, the package manager for macOS.

## Verifying Installation

To verify that Homebrew is installed correctly, run:

```bash
brew --version
```

You should see output like:

```
Homebrew 4.0.0
```
